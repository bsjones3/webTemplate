# webTemplate
# This is a website template. The purpose of this repository is to provide myself/others with a simple baseline website with an account
system implemented.
# Future use cases include extending the functionality of the site. Allowing for clean, working code versus other website generators or
WYSIWYG editors
# The technology stack used is XAMPP: a local apache web server instance for testing, MySQL, and PHP.
